# server_client
Server client connection via socket. This is done through the following files

- server.py : making the message and sending it. This server also measures various time stamps.
- client.py : receiving the message and sending a simple message back

Once the connection is made and data is transferred, a file <i>report.txt</i> is generated. This file can be processed and even plotted by <i>read_report.py</i>.

The message from the server socket is made using a sine wave which is generated by:

- generate_sine.py: generate a sine wave with given parameters

## Sine generator

Amplitude, frequency, extension with zeros, sampling frequency and the duration of the sine wave can be adjusted.



## Server

Server prepares the data in the following format:
'#2+1234+1234+1234+1234+1234+1234'.
